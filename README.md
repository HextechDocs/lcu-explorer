# LCU Explorer

---

A replacement for rift explorer which doesn't need restarting from the original contributors

## Usage

- Download the [latest release from GitHub](https://github.com/HextechDocs/lcu-explorer/releases/latest) (exe installer or unpacked standalone zip).
- LCU Explorer should start after installing, or start manually after unzipping.
- If the LoL client is not already running, start it now.
  - Endpoints will show immediately after launching, but "try it out" is hidden unless the client is running.
